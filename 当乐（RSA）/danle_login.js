*
* RSA.js is a suite of routines for performing RSA public-key computations
* in JavaScript.  The cryptographic functions herein are used for encoding
* and decoding strings to be sent over unsecure channels.
*
* To use these routines, a pair of public/private keys is created through a
* number of means (OpenSSL tools on Linux/Unix, Dave Shapiro's
* RSAKeyGenerator program on Windows).  These keys are passed to RSAKeyPair
* as hexadecimal strings to create an encryption key object.  This key object
* is then used with encryptedString to encrypt blocks of plaintext using the
* public key.  The resulting cyphertext blocks can be decrypted with
* decryptedString.
*
* Note that the cryptographic functions herein are complementary to those
* found in CryptoFuncs.php and CryptoFuncs.pm.  Hence, encrypted messages may
* be sent between programs written in any of those languages.  The most
* useful, of course is to send messages encrypted by a Web page using RSA.js
* to a PHP or Perl script running on a Web servitron.
*
* Also, the optional padding flag may be specified on the call to
* encryptedString, in which case blocks of cyphertext that are compatible
* with real crypto libraries such as OpenSSL or Microsoft will be created.
* These blocks of cyphertext can then be sent to Web servitron that uses one
* of these crypto libraries for decryption.  This allows messages encrypted
* with longer keys to be decrypted quickly on the Web server as well as
* making for more secure communications when a padding algorithm such as
* PKCS1v1.5 is used.
*
* These routines require BigInt.js and Barrett.js.

*                                       attempt to derive a key length (but,

*                                       used to encrypt/decrypt messages.
*
* This routine is invoked as the first step in the encryption or decryption
* process to take the three numbers (expressed as hexadecimal strings) that
* are used for RSA asymmetric encryption/decryption and turn them into a key
* object that can be used for encrypting and decrypting.
*
* The key object is created thusly:
*
*      RSAKey = new RSAKeyPair("ABC12345", 10001, "987654FE");
*
* or:
*
*      RSAKey = new RSAKeyPair("ABC12345", 10001, "987654FE", 64);
*
* Note that RSAKeyPair will try to derive the length of the key that is being
* used, from the key itself.  The key length is especially useful when one of
* the padding options is used and/or when the encrypted messages created by
* the routine encryptedString are exchanged with a real crypto library such
* as OpenSSL or Microsoft, as it determines how many padding characters are
* appended.
*
* Usually, RSAKeyPair can determine the key length from the modulus of the
* key but this doesn't always work properly, depending on the actual value of
* the modulus.  If you are exchanging messages with a real crypto library,
* such as OpenSSL or Microsoft, that depends on the fact that the blocks
* being passed to it are properly padded, you'll want the key length to be
* set properly.  If that's the case, of if you just want to be sure, you
* should specify the key length that you used to generated the key, in bits
* when this routine is invoked.

*
* This routine accepts a plaintext string that is to be encrypted with the
* public key component of the previously-built RSA key using the RSA
* assymmetric encryption method.  Before it is encrypted, the plaintext
* string is padded to the same length as the encryption key for proper
* encryption.
*
* Depending on the padding method chosen, an optional header with block type
* is prepended, the plaintext is padded using zeros or randomly-generated
* bytes, and then the plaintext is possibly broken up into chunks.
*
* Note that, for padding with zeros, this routine was altered by Rob Saunders
* (rob@robsaunders.net). The new routine pads the string after it has been
* converted to an array. This fixes an incompatibility with Flash MX's
* ActionScript.
*
* The various padding schemes employed by this routine, and as presented to
* RSA for encryption, are shown below.  Note that the RSA encryption done
* herein reverses the byte order as encryption is done:

*                                       with the RSA key.
*
* This routine is the complementary decryption routine that is meant to be
* used for JavaScript decryption of cyphertext blocks that were encrypted
* using the OHDave padding method of the encryptedString routine (in this
* module).  It can also decrypt cyphertext blocks that were encrypted by
* RSAEncode (in CryptoFuncs.pm or CryptoFuncs.php) so that encrypted
* messages can be sent of insecure links (e.g. HTTP) to a Web page.
*
* It accepts a cyphertext string that is to be decrypted with the public key
* component of the previously-built RSA key using the RSA assymmetric
* encryption method.  Multiple cyphertext blocks are broken apart, if they
* are found in c, and each block is decrypted.  All of the decrypted blocks
* are concatenated back together to obtain the original plaintext string.
*
* This routine assumes that the plaintext was padded to the same length as
* the encryption key with zeros.  Therefore, it removes any zero bytes that
* are found at the end of the last decrypted block, before it is appended to
* the decrypted plaintext string.
*
* Note that the encryptedString routine (in this module) works fairly quickly
* simply by virtue of the fact that the public key most often chosen is quite
* short (e.g. 0x10001).  This routine does not have that luxury.  The
* decryption key that it must employ is the full key length.  For long keys,
* this can result in serious timing delays (e.g. 7-8 seconds to decrypt using
* 2048 bit keys on a reasonably fast machine, under the Firefox Web browser).
*
* If you intend to send encrypted messagess to a JavaScript program running
* under a Web browser, you might consider using shorter keys to keep the
* decryption times low.  Alternately, a better scheme is to generate a random
* key for use by a symmetric encryption algorithm and transmit it to the
* other end, after encrypting it with encryptedString.  The other end can use
* a real crypto library (e.g. OpenSSL or Microsoft) to decrypt the key and
* then use it to encrypt all of the messages (with a symmetric encryption
* algorithm such as Twofish or AES) bound for the JavaScript program.
* Symmetric decryption is orders of magnitude faster than asymmetric and
* should yield low decryption times, even when executed in JavaScript.
*
* Also note that only the OHDave padding method (e.g. zeros) is supported by
* this routine *AND* that this routine expects little-endian cyphertext, as
* created by the encryptedString routine (in this module) or the RSAEncode
* routine (in either CryptoFuncs.pm or CryptoFuncs.php).  You can use one of
* the real crypto libraries to create cyphertext that can be decrypted by
* this routine, if you reverse the plaintext byte order first and then
* manually pad it with zero bytes.  The plaintext should then be encrypted
* with the NoPadding flag or its equivalent in the crypto library of your
* choice.

// IMPORTANT THING: Be sure to set maxDigits according to your precision

//
// Tweaked by Ian Bunning
// Alterations:
// Fix bug in function biFromHex(s) to allow
// parsing of strings of length != 0 (mod 4)

// Changes made by Dave Shapiro as of 12/30/2004:
//
// The BigInt() constructor doesn't take a string anymore. If you want to
// create a BigInt from a string, use biFromDecimal() for base-10
// representations, biFromHex() for base-16 representations, or
// biFromString() for base-2-to-36 representations.
//
// biFromArray() has been removed. Use biCopy() instead, passing a BigInt
// instead of an array.
//
// The BigInt() constructor now only constructs a zeroed-out array.
// Alternatively, if you pass <true>, it won't construct any array. See the
// biCopy() method for an example of this.
//
// Be sure to set maxDigits depending on your precision needs. The default
// zeroed-out array ZERO_ARRAY is constructed inside the setMaxDigits()
// function. So use this function to set the variable. DON'T JUST SET THE
// VALUE. USE THE FUNCTION.
//
// ZERO_ARRAY exists to hopefully speed up construction of BigInts(). By
// precalculating the zero array, we can just use slice(0) to make copies of
// it. Presumably this calls faster native code, as opposed to setting the
// elements one at a time. I have not done any timing tests to verify this
// claim.

// Max number = 10^16 - 2 = 9999999999999998;
